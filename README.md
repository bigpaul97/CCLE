# Conserved-current loop extrusion (CCLE)
This repository contains all the necessary codes for running the CCLE simulation, carrying out experiment-simulation Hi-C comparison, and calculating various metrics for goodness-of-fit.

CCLE_main:
This folder comprehensively contains the codes for the CCLE simulation program. 
The only input file is the file of ChIP-seq data of the protein of interest. The most important output of the program is the simulated Hi-C map.
